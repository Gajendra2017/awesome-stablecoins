# Awesome Stablecoins

A curated list of stable cryptocurrency resources and projects

## What are stable cryptocurrencies?
> "Stablecoins, in their most ideal form, are simply cryptocurrencies with stable value...usable as a store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account."
  -- [Multicoin Capital: An Overview of Stablecoins](https://multicoin.capital/2018/01/17/an-overview-of-stablecoins/)

## Prior art
  - Issuing shares, [fiat](https://www.coindesk.com/lhv-bank-backs-wallet-app-built-on-bitcoins-blockchain/), and other assets with [Bitcoin Script](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Colored_Coins#Issuing_shares), most commonly using  `OP_RETURN` to attach metadata to fractions of a Bitcoin.

## Applications
- Markets/Exchanges: as a hedge against crypto volatility for traders, creation of new trading pairs, fiat-denominated on-chain derivates and other financial instruments, prediction markets
- DApps: medium of exchange for DApps, prediction markets, insurance
- Commerce: international remittance, on-chain fiat payment integrations
